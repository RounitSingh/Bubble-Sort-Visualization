## Approach
<ul>
  <li> First, we will generate a random array using Math.random() function.
       </li>
  <li> Different colors are used to indicate which elements are being compared, sorted, and 
       unsorted.  </li>
  <li> Since the algorithm performs the operation very fast, the setTimeout() function has been 
       used to slow down the process. </li>
  <li> New array can be generated by pressing the “Ctrl+R” key.
       The sorting is performed using BubbleSort() function using swap() function </li>
</ul>

## Fuunctionalities
<ul>
  <li> Demonstrated the step-by-step execution of the bubble sort algorithm, 
        providing a clear understanding of how the algorithm works.

</li>
  <li> Represented visually how the bubble sort algorithm works. Users were 
       able to see the array elements being sorted in real-time.

 </li>
 
</ul>
